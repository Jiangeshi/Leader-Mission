你们在mod制作期间提出了大量宝贵的建议，使得mod更加完善。同时，平衡性的提高永远是进行时，各位玩家反应的越多，mod的整体平衡性也会越高，各位可以在github中新建议题进行反馈，也可以在mod内测群（780959855）中直接@我反馈，我会第一时间给出答复。
		
最后，我要特别感谢以下三人：
		
逍遥渡影
X
遗封
		
逍遥渡影大佬是我成为modder的引路人，b站上逍遥渡影的mod制作教程非常不错，虽然有些内容随着游戏版本更新已经有修改，但是对于新人想要学习制作mod而言，逍遥渡影大佬的教程是非常有用的。
		
其次是mod界的老前辈X大佬，感谢X大佬在我最迷茫的时候给予我的支持，对于一个新人来说，来自前辈的肯定非常的鼓舞人心。另外X大佬的mod也正在制作中，各位可以期待一手。
		
最后是遗封，遗封在mod的制作过程中提供了很多宝贵的意见，也第一时间在文明制作完成后帮忙进行测试，同时也是不算正规的第一届承天景命杯冠军。感谢遗封大佬在mod制作过程中的支持。非常感谢。
		
最后的最后，我还要感谢一个人，那就是U圈共主xk。xk作为unciv中国社区的管理者，不仅为我们提供了Unciv中文官方群（945184632），也提供了诸如pan.unciv.tk的公共网盘，以及中国区服务器的维护。如果没有xk大佬的无私付出，可能中国U圈不会像如今这样茁壮成长。
		
感谢各位玩家，你们的游玩与反馈就是我制作mod的动力，Leader Mission 将会持续保持更新，定不会辜负各位的期待。

以上。"

Leader Mission 模组中的胜利方式有：

征服胜利：
占领所有城市。
		
时间胜利：
在游戏内到达设定的回合时获得最高的文明积分。
		
宗教胜利：
建造圣殿并使自己创立的宗教成为世界所有主流文明的主要宗教。
主要宗教判定（猜测）：该文明信仰你宗教的城市是否大于一半。
如果创立宗教的文明已经灭亡了，但是宗教成为了世界主流宗教，该文明并不会触发宗教胜利。
		
飞天胜利：
建造所有需要的飞船部件并将他们运送至首都组装，成功建造太空飞船。
		
灾害胜利：
在获得足够的CO2后建造天气控制器。
		
外交胜利：
在有任何文明建造联合国后取得外交投票中的多数票。
城邦也拥有票数。
自己无法投票给自己。
        
制度胜利：
在完成五项政策分支后建造乌托邦。
        
魅力胜利（计划中）：
在获得足够的魅力值后建造世界博览会。
